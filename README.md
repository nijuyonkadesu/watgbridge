# WhatsApp-Telegram-Bridge

Despite the name, its not exactly a "bridge". It forwards messages from WhatsApp to Telegram and you can reply to them
from Telegram.

## Features and Design Choices

- All messages from various chats (on WhatsApp) are sent to different topics/threads within the same target group (on Telegram)
- Configuration options available to disable different types of updates from WhatsApp
- Can reply and send new messages from Telegram
- Can tag all people using @all or @everyone. Others can also use this in group chats which you specify in configuration file
- Can react to messages by replying with single instance of the desired emoji
- Supports static stickers from both ends
- Can send Animated (TGS) stickers from Telegram
- Video stickers from Telegram side are supported
- Video stickers from WhatsApp side are currently forwarded as GIFs to Telegram

## Bugs and TODO

- Document naming is messed up and not consistent on Telegram, have to find a way to always send same names

PRs are welcome :)

## Installation

- Make a supergroup (enable message history for new members) with topics enabled
- Add your bot in the group, make it an admin with permissions to `Manage topics`
- Install `git`, `gcc` and `golang`, `ffmpeg` , `imagemagick` (optional), on your system
- Clone this repository anywhere and navigate to the cloned directory
- Run `go build`
- Copy `sample_config.yaml` to `config.yaml` and fill the values, there are comments to help you.
- Execute the binary by running `./watgbridge`
- On first run, it will show QR code for logging into WhatsApp that can by scanned by the WhatsApp app in `Linked devices`
- It is recommended to restart the bot after every few hours becuase WhatsApp likes to disconnect a lot. So a sample Systemd service file has been provided (`watgbridge.service.sample`). Edit the `User` and `ExecStart` according to your setup:
  - If you do not have local bot API server, remove `tgbotapi.service` from the `After` key in `Unit` section.
  - This service file will restart the bot every 24 hours

# Systemd Service

- place the file in `etc/systemd/system/` with your user scope
- have to check if telegram-bot-api.service's /data & /temp 770 permission
- start your database

- TODO: watgbride dockerfile, FROM scratch, copy the binary, mount tg volumes
- so now it's isolated and doesn't matter if runs in root

# Playground

```sh
sudo nvim /etc/containers/homelab/portable-postgres.env
sudo chmod 770 /etc/containers/homelab/portable-postgres.env
sudo cp portable-postgres.container /etc/containers/systemd/
/usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/podman-system-generator --dryrun

sudo podman ps

# cloning postgres
pg_dump -U guts -h localhost -p 5432 watgbridge | psql -U guts -h ustable -d watgbridge
scp -P 8022 u0_a342@watgtunnel:~/watgbridge/wawebstore.db ~/redacted/watgbridge
scp -P 8022 u0_a342@watgtunnel:~/watgbridge/config.yaml ~/redacted/watgbridge

# copy watgbridge.service
sudo cp watgbridge.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable watgbridge.service
sudo systemctl start watgbridge.service

journalctl -u watgbridge.service -f

1. dispatcher.AddGroupHandlers

   - (-1) for middleware, is allowed first of all
   - (0) once allowed - then check for admin? or check for command? - I think it's not configured in the best way in watgbride??
   - (10+) for application logic??

2. BridgeTelegramToWhatsAppHandler.TgUpdateIsAuthorized - move this as a middleware instead of checking in telegram utils - dayum, 19 references.

## NewModules

1. demotivator module [Frame + centralized caption]
   - add russian translation for authentic flavour
2. media download module - check that go mod
3. regex substitute module
4. LLM Interaction Module (with #llm flag or smth) - save llms and choose based on callback or smth
